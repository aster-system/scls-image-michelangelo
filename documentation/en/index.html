            <h3>What is SCLS ?</h3>
            <div>
                SCLS, for "Simple C++ Libraries Set", is a sets of C++ library, which means to make C++ development <i>almost</i> as easy as in Python.
            </div>
            <h3>What is SCLS Image ?</h3>
            <div>
                SCLS Image allows its users to do some very simple image manipulation in C++.
                It should also be very light to use, and allows to do complex image manipulation in a few lines.</br></br>
                It is name "Michelangelo" named after one of the greatest painter of all time, Michelangelo.

                As mentionned in a <a href="#how_to_use">next part</a>, the license allows you to watch the code of the library.</br>
                If you're are new with C++, you can learn from this library.
                As the creator of the library, I STRONGLY RECOMMEND you to watch the code and learn from it. It is made to be simple to read and user-friendly.</br>
                If you know well C++, you can watch the code too, but it's certainly not the better code you have watched in your life.
                You can change and upgrade it if you want. If you publish it, we would be strongly grateful if you could mention us, or contact us to make your upgrade an official upgrade.
